This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to EFM32JG12B peripherals.

## Usage

Each device supported by this crate is behind a feature gate so that you only
compile the device(s) you want. To use, in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies.efm32jg12b-pac]
version = "0.1.4"
features = ["efm32jg12b500"]
```

The `rt` feature is enabled by default and brings in support for `cortex-m-rt`.
To disable, specify `default-features = false` in `Cargo.toml`.

For full details on the autogenerated API, please see `svd2rust` Peripheral API [here].
